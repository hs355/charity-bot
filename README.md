A Reddit Bot That Makes Charity Suggestions Relevant to Posts

Social media sometimes gets a bad rap for being an unfriendly space. However, there are many occasions where users ask how to help or contribute to a cause. For this project, we created a Reddit Bot, that when invoked (!charitybot), recommends charities users can contribute to. The recommendation is based on the content of the post. The content of the post is matched with a database of charity mission statements and the charities that most closely relate to the post are returned.
